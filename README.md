# Texas Hold'em Poker Game

This is a simplified version of the popular **Texas Hold'em Poker** game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project allows two players to compete in a game of Texas Hold'em by dealing cards, showing community cards, and determining the winner based on hand rankings.

## Features
- **Card Deck Generation & Shuffling**: A deck of 52 cards is dynamically generated and shuffled for each game.
- **Player Hand Dealing**: Two cards are dealt to each player.
- **Community Cards**: The five community cards (Flop, Turn, River) are revealed during the game.
- **Simple Winner Calculation**: The game compares the highest card from each player to determine the winner. (Advanced poker hand rankings coming soon!)
- **Responsive Design**: Styled using CSS, with card images displayed for each player and the community cards.
